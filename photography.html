	<h1>Photography</h1>
	<h3>Photography is something that I didn't start being interested in at one certain point. Throughout my life, I have always been interested in taking photos. It wasn't until after I took a photography camp in 2019 that my interest grew larger. I have really enjoyed learning about the camera, its features and playing around with things like photoshop. </h3>
