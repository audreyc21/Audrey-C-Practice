	<h1>Rock Climbing</h1>
	<h3>I also started rock climbing when I injured myself at gymnastics. I started to look into rock climbing because my sister was on the climbing team. When I started the team, it was intense, but was really fun. I love being able to work through each problem and try to come up with unique ways to finish the climbs</h3>
