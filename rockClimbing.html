	<h1>Rock Climbing</h1>
	<h3>I also started rock climbing when I injured myself at gymnastics. I started to look into rock climbing because my sister was already on the climbing team. When I started the team, it was intense, but was really fun. I love being able to work through each problem, trying to come up with unique ways to finish the climbs.</h3>
